## Deployment

Once you are ready to deploy to production please remember to build the project first:

```sh
NODE_ENV=production npm run build
```

Get your Flyyer key from [https://flyyer.io/dashboard/_/settings](https://flyyer.io/dashboard/_/settings) and set it as an environment variable:

```sh
# in your terminal
export FLYYER_KEY=...
```

Alternatively you can create a `.env` file:

```sh
# .env
FLYYER_KEY=...
```

Deploy to production

```sh
npm run deploy
```

You can find the live URL for your deck in the terminal output, it is something like: `https://cdn.flyyer.io/render/v2/tenant/deck/template`.

## Usage

Append queryparams to your URLs and we will set those as props when rendering.

## FAQ & Caveats

### What is Flyyer studio?

It's a browser app that opens your local server (localhost:7777) in multiple _iframes_ so you can have a better developer experience. It works best on Firefox.

### SCSS Support

Sure. Install `npm install --save sass` and just import your SASS/SCSS files just like: `import "/styles.scss"`.

> See: https://docs.flyyer.io/docs/features/styles

### Custom fonts

Refer to https://docs.flyyer.io/docs/features/fonts. If you are building a template for the community and want to support on-the-fly fonts you can use: [flyyer/use-googlefonts](https://github.com/useflyyer/use-googlefonts).

### Nested directories

**This is not implemented yet. Please prefer a flat `/templates` directory.** This means you have to avoid folders inside `/templates`.

Folders outside `/templates` is ok 👍

### Development server crashes or stop previewing

The development server (`npm run start`) can be buggy sometimes. Please restart the server if you encounter any problems.
